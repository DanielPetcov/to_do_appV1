# To Do App
## _By me, yeah_


This is a basic To-Do-App that I tried to make using __React__,
It's goal is to demostrate what I learned throw the proccess of building this app.
Here are some key technologies that I used:

- React
- Html
- Css
- ✨Animate.css✨ 

## Features

- You can add a task
- You can delete a task

In the future I plan to improve this app, maybe add a timer
or improve the user experience.
